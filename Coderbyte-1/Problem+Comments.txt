Q: Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. 
For example: if the input string is "Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string sredoC dna dlroW olleH. 
Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

C: I am unhappy with my solution. I went with the first solution that came into my head, which was to make a copy of the string
and then build the reverse string by iterating over it backwards. This obviously comes at a cost of memory, so I will want to revisit
this one later.
