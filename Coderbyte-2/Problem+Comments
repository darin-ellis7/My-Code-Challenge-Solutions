P: Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it (e.g. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)). For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer. 
Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

C: Pretty simple. My only mistake was forgetting a colon at the while loop initialization (whoops).
