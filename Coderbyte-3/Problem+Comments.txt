Q: Have the function LetterChanges(str) take the str parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm. 
Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). 
Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string. 
Use the Parameter Testing feature in the box below to test your code with different arguments.

C: This one was trickier than the last. I immediately realized I could use the ASCII representation of characters to add 1 to
a letter to make it the next letter in the alphabet. Then I had to handle the wraparound (from z/Z to a/A). The main issue I had was 
a false assumption that I would only be dealing with letters. The input strings could have operators or whitespace in them, that were
to remain unchanged. As they are also represented in ASCII, my intial approach changed them too. With as many conditional branches as I
have, I cannot help but wonder if there would be a more concise approach.
